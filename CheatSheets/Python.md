##Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted and object-oriented programming language.
It's fundamental principles emphasizes with the use of significant indentation.
Python was created by Guido Van Rossum.
Python can be used for:
*`web development`
*`GUI development`
*`Scientific and Numeric`
*`Software development`
*`System Administration`
Python is most popular for it's use for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Analysis.

##Sample of Python program
```
print('Hello world!')
```
* The Python print() function helps in printing the specified message onto the screen, or any other standard output device.

##Basic Data Types

| Data-types | Type|
|----|----|
|`str` | String(Text)|
|`int` | Numbers|
|`bool` | True or False|
|`dict` | Hash table type|
|`tuple` |Immutable sequence type|
|`set` |Unordered collection type|
|`float`|Decimal point numbers|
|`list` |Ordered and changeable|

* `list` is denoted by `[]`.A list can have any number of items and they may be of different types.
E.g 
```
my_list = [1, "Python", 3.4, True]
```
* `dict` is denoted by `{}`. It is expressed as a pair (key: value). 
While the values can be of any data type and can repeat, keys must be of immutable type (string, number or tuple with immutable elements) and must be unique.
E.g 
```
my_dict = {'name': 'Python', 1: [2, 4, 3]}

```
* `tuple` is denoted by `()`. A tuple is an immutable object, which means it cannot be changed, and we use it to represent fixed collections of items.
E.g
```
a_tuple = ('abc', 123, 0.1312)
```
* `set` is denoted by `{}`. A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed).
E.g
```
my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}
```


###Variables, Assignment and creating user input
* A variable is a string of characters and numbers associated with a piece of information.
* The assignment operator,is denoted by the `=` symbol, is the operator that is used to assign values to variables in Python.
* Creating user input is denoted with the `input` keyword.
* E.g
  ```
  name = input('What is your name? ')
  print(name)
  ```
