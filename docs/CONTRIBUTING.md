# How to Contribute

---

The `CHEATSHEETS FOR DEVELOPERS` project can only grow through the contributions of the community. We appreciate your enthusiasm and contribution in helping our initiative.

## Creating an issue

---

- Make sure you are using appropriate template that corresponds to your issue.
- If your **issue** is different from provided templates, start a plain issue without using the template.

## Submitting a pull request

---

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- For a new feature or function, please create an issue first to discuss it with us before submitting a pull request.
- Keep your change as focused as possible.
  - If there are changes in multiple directories you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, please submit them as separate pull requests.
- The pull request should have a useful title and description.
  - Explain the rationale for your change in the pull request using a pull request template.
- Here's a quick guid to create a pull request:
  - Fork the github project.
  - Clone the git repository
    ```(bash)
    $ git clone
    https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/CheatSheets-for-Developers.git
    ```
  - When your implementation is ready, [submit a pull request][pr]. Add some comments or screen shots to help us.
  - Wait for us to review your pull request. If something is wrong or if we want you to make some changes before the merge, we'll let you know through commit comments or pull request comments.
