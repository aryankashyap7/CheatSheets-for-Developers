## Synopsis

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. Containers are created from images that specify their precise contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from public repositories.

## Run a new Container

Container is a running instance of an image. You can run a container from an image using the `docker run` command.

```bash
# Run a container from an image
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]

# Run a container from an image and attach to it
docker run -it [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

| `docker network inspect`    | Display detailed information on one or more networks |
| `docker network ls`         | List networks                                        |
| `docker network prune`      | Remove all unused networks                           |
| `docker network rm`         | Remove one or more networks                          |

## Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.

| Command                 | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker volume create`  | Create a volume                                     |
| `docker volume inspect` | Display detailed information on one or more volumes |
| `docker volume ls`      | List volumes                                        |
| `docker volume prune`   | Remove all unused local volumes                     |
| `docker volume rm`      | Remove one or more volumes                          |

## Docker Secrets

Docker secrets are sensitive data which you don’t want to store in a Dockerfile or in your application’s source code unencrypted. Docker secrets are encrypted during transit and at rest in a Docker swarm. A given secret is only accessible to those services which have been granted explicit access to it, and only while those service tasks are running.

| Command                 | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker secret create`  | Create a secret                                     |
| `docker secret inspect` | Display detailed information on one or more secrets |
| `docker secret ls`      | List secrets                                        |
| `docker secret rm`      | Remove one or more secrets                          |

## Docker Stack

Docker stack is a set of interrelated services that share dependencies, and can be orchestrated and scaled together. A stack is defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.

| Command                 | Description                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `docker stack deploy`   | Deploy a new stack or update an existing one |
| `docker stack ls`       | List stacks                                  |
| `docker stack ps`       | List the tasks in the stack                  |
| `docker stack rm`       | Remove one or more stacks                    |
| `docker stack services` | List the services in the stack               |

## Docker BuildKit

Docker BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. It provides a common set of operations for building container images and artifacts.

| Command         | Description                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `docker build`  | Build an image from a Dockerfile |
| `docker buildx` | Build with BuildKit              |

## Docker Security

Docker security is a set of features that allow you to secure your Docker containers and images.

| Command       | Description                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `docker scan` | Scan the image for vulnerabilities |
