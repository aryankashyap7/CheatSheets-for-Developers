## Synopsis

Security+ is a vendor-neutral certification that validates the baseline skills and knowledge required to perform core security functions and pursue an IT security career. The Security+ exam covers a broad range of topics including security administration, threats and vulnerabilities, access control, cryptography, and organizational security.

# 1: Introduction to Security

CIA : Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

    - Confidentiality : Prevents disclosure of information to outside party
    - Integrity : Guarantees data has not been tampered with
    - Availability : Resources can be accessed when needed

AAA : Authentication, Authorization, Accounting(non-repudiation)

    - Authentication : Confirms one’s identity e.g.) username/password, biometrics, signature etc
    - Authorization : Allows one to access certain materials e.g.) ACL(Access Control Lists), Linux permission bits etc
    - Accounting : Tracking of data/comp./netwrk resources usage for individualse.g.) Logging, auditing, data/network monitoring

Types of Threats

    - Malicious Software
    - Unauthorized Access
    - System Failure
    - Social Engineering

Physical, Technical, Administrative Security plans

    - Physical : Physical security systems such as alarms, ID cards, CCTV etc
    - Technical : Smart cards, ACLs, encryption etc
    - Administrative : Policies, procedures, DRP(Disaster recovery plan) etc

Protection Methods

    - User Awareness
    - Authentication
    - Anti-malware
    - Data Backups
    - Encryption
    - Data Removal

\*Good security plan + Good protection method = Solid defense (Defense in depth)

Types of Hackers

    - White Hat
    - Black Hat
    - Grey Hat
    - Blue Hat (Bounty Hunters)
    - Elites (Zero day discoverers)

Types of Attackers

    - Script Kiddie
    - Hacktivist
    - Organized Crime
    - APT(Advanced Persistent Threat aka Nation state attacker)

## 2 : Computer Systems Security Part 1 (Malware)

Types of Malware

    - Viruses
    	Malicious code executed by the user, lives on a file
    	> Boot Sector : Placed in first hard drive sector
    	> Macro : Placed into documents
    	> Program : Infects executables
    	> Encrypted : Avoids detection through encryption
    	> Polymorphic : Decryption module changes with every infection
    	> Metamorphic : Whole virus code changes with every infection
    	> Stealth
    	> Armored : Misdirects antivirus away from its actual location
    	> Multipartite : Hybrid of boot sector and program
    - Worms
    Malicious code that replicates, standalone program, may spread automatically
    - Trojans
    	Appear to be beneficial but contain malicious code
    	> Keygens
    	> RAT Trojans
    - Ransomware
    	Encrypts files and data and demands payment to unlock
    	Often propagates as a Trojan or a worm
    - Spyware
    	Usually hidden inside third party applications
    	Logs various user activities and sends it to attacker
    	Also associated with Adware and Grayware
    - Rootkits
    	Designed to gain administrative control over a machine
    	Hard to detect b/c it targets low level(UEFI/BIOS, kernel etc)
    	Activates before Antivirus/OS
    - Spam
    	Abuse of electronic messaging system

Malware Delivery

    Treat Vector vs Attack Vector
    - Software, Messaging and Media
    	> Emails, FTP, P2P/torrent file downloads
    	> Removable Media
    - Typosquatting
    - Exploit kit
    - Botnets and Zombies
    	> Also used for DDOS or financial gain
    - Active Interception (MITM)
    - Privilege Escalation
    - Backdoor
    	> Authentication bypass mechanisms built into the program itself
    - Logic Bombs
    	> Triggers malware on certain condition(date, OS type etc)

Malware Prevention / Troubleshooting
Common Symptoms : Slow computer speed, crashes, incorrect home page, popups
Common Prevention > Antivirus : Regular updates and scans
Detects : worms, viruses and Trojans
Does not detect : Botnet activity, rootkits, logic bombs > Firewalls and Regular OS updates > Separation of OS and data > Hardware + Software based firewall (e.g. router + Windows Firewall) > Encryption for confidentiality (Windows EFS)
Common Steps to Malware Removal 1. Identify Symptoms 2. Quarantine infected system / drive to clean machine 3. Disable System Restore 4. Remediate affected system > Update AV / Scan and removal 5. Schedule scans and run update 6. Enable system restore and set new restore point 7. Educate end user
Worms and Trojans > Antivirus, Regular maintenance and vigilance
Spyware > Antivirus, browser security settings, remove unnecessary application > End user education
Rootkits > Antivirus, Rootkit detectors (USB bootable OS) > Use UEFI over BIOS (GPT over MBR) > Wipe the entire drive & reinstall OS
Spam > Spam filter, whitelisting/blacklisting, close open mail relays

## 3 : Computer Systems Security Part 2

Security Applications

    - Personal Firewalls (Host based firewalls)
    	> Windows Firewall
    	> ZoneAlarm
    	> Packet Filter and IP Firewall (Mac OSX)
    	> iptables (Linux)
    - IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    	Host Based : Loaded onto individual machine
    			 Analyzes and monitors that one machine state
    			 Can interpret encrypted traffic
    	Network Based : Either loaded onto a machine or standalone device
    			    Monitors every packet going through network interface
    			    Monitors multiple devices, less expensive
    			    Cannot monitor what happens in an OS
    - Monitoring Types –
    Statistical Anomaly vs Signature
    		> Statistical Anomaly Establishes baseline and compares current performance
    		> Signature
    			Network traffic analyzed to find predetermined patterns
    	HIDS examples
    		> Trend Micro OSSEC (freeware)
    		> Verisys (Commercial, Windows)
    		> Tripwire (Commercial)
    	* Make sure to protect HIDS database with encryption and access control
    - Popup Blockers
    	Ad filtering & Content filtering
    - DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
    	Monitors data in use / in motion / at rest
    	Prevents unauthorized use and leakage of data
    	Types of DLP
    		> Endpoint DLP : Runs on single machine, software based
    		> Network DLP : Software/hardware, installed on network perimeter
    		> Storage DLP : Installed in data centers/server rooms

Securing Computer Hardware and Peripherals
Examples of peripherals: USB flash drives, SATA external HDD, optical disks
Securing BIOS - Flashing (Updating) BIOS firmware - BIOS password - Configure BIOS Boot order - Secure boot (disables unsigned device drivers, UEFI) \* UEFI and Root of Trust, secure/measured boot, attestation
Securing Storage Devices - Removable Storage > Typically prohibits all removable storage besides specific ones > Removable Media Controls
USB Lockdown (BIOS), limit USB use, malware scans, audits - NAS (Network Attached Storage) > Built for high availability (no downtime) > Commonly implemented as RAID array (levels depend on situation) > Use encryption, authentication, secure logging etc - Whole Disk Encryption > Requires either self encrypting or full disk encryption SW > Windows BitLocker requirements 1) TPM or External USB key with encrypted keys 2) Hard drive with 2 volumes(1 for boot, 1 to be encrypted) > Double Encryption – BitLocker + EFS - HSM (Hardware Security Modules)
Vs TPM
TPM handles key storage with limited cryptographic function
HSM handles mainly quick crypto functions with key storage
Found in USB attachment or network attached device

Securing Wireless Peripherals - Force devices to use AES or WPA2 encryption for data transmission

Securing Mobile Devices
General Security - Keep phone number secure and do not respond to unsolicited calls - Update mobile device OS - Complex password and limit downloads to device
Malware - Install & update mobile device AV - Take use of built in security features - Avoid following links, don’t store information on device - Don’t post info on social media
Botnet Activity - Follow anti-malware procedures - Avoid rooting / jailbreaking phones
SIM Cloning - A cloned SIM redirects all calls and texts to its own device - Able to hijack messages intended for original SIM card owner
Wireless Attacks - Bluejacking - Bluesnarfing

    Theft
    	- Full device encryption(FDE)
    	- Set up GPS tracking
    	- Remote lock & Remote wipe technology
    Mobile Application
    	- Mobile key management : use Third party software (Verisign)
    	- Application whitelisting / blacklisting
    	- Strong SMS application and endpoint security
    	- Mobile payment : avoid public networks, user education
    	- Geotagging : Disable GPS depending on situation
    	- BYOD concerns
    		> Storage Segmentation : divide corporate vs private data storage
    		> Mobile Device Management systems for corporations
