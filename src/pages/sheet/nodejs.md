## Synopsis

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine
and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.

## Running Node JS

For running Node JS:

| Command          | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| node             | Run the Node REPL in your terminal   |
| node â€”version    | Print your current Node version      |
| node filename.js | Execute the Node code in filename.js |

> ðŸ’¡ `REPL` stands for *R*ead *E*val *P*rint *L*oop. This is the list of steps that happen when you run the `node` command and then type some code.

---

## Node JS Global Object

In Node, we have a `global` object that we can always access. Features that we expect to be available everywhere live in this `global` object.
For example, to have some code execute after 5 seconds we can use either `global.setTimeout` or just `setTimeout`. The `global` keyword is optional.

> ```node
> setTimeout(() => {
>   console.log("hello");
> }, 5000);
> ```
>
> The most famous global is `global.console.log` which we write as just `console.log`.

## Node JS Module System

In Node.js, each file is treated as a separate module. Modules provide us a way of re-using existing code

**The Required Function**  
We can re-use existing code by using the Node built-in `require()` function. This function imports code from another module.

> ```node
> const fs = require("fs");
> fs.readFileSync("hello.txt");
>
> // OR...
>
> const { readFileSync } = require("fs");
> readFileSync("hello.txt");
> ```

**Built-in Modules**  
Some modules like fs are built in to Node. These modules contain Node-specific features.

_Key built-in modules include:_

- _fs_ -- read and write files on your file system
- _path_ -- combine paths regardless of which OS you're using
- _process_ -- information about the currently running process, e.g. process.argv for arguments passed in or process.env for environment variables
- _http_ -- make requests and create HTTP servers
- _https_ -- work with secure HTTP servers using SSL/TLS
- _events_ -- work with the EventEmitter
- _crypto_ -- cryptography tools like encryption and hashing

**Creating Modules**  
We can create our own modules by exporting a function from a file and importing it in another module.

> ```node
> // In src/fileModule.js
> function read(filename) {}
> function write(filename, data) {}
>
> module.exports = {
>   read,
>   write,
> };
>
> // In src/sayHello.js
> const { write } = require("./fileModule.js");
> write("hello.txt", "Hello world!");
> ```

Some Node modules may instead use the shorthand syntax to export functions.

> ```node
> // In src/fileModule.js
> exports.read = function read(filename) {};
> exports.write = function write(filename, data) {};
> ```

**ECMAScript Modules**  
The imports above use a syntax known as CommonJS (CJS) modules. Node treats JavaScript code as CommonJS modules by default. More recently, you may have seen the ECMAScript module (ESM) syntax. This is the syntax that is used by TypeScript.

> ```node
> // In src/fileModule.mjs
> function read(filename) {}
> function write(filename, data) {}
>
> export { read, write };
>
> // In src/sayHello.mjs
> import { write } from "./response.mjs";
> write("hello.txt", "Hello world!");
> ```

We tell Node to treat JavaScript code as an ECMAScript module by using the .mjs file extension. Pick one approach and use it consistently throughout your Node project.

## Node JS Package Manager

Node developers often publicly share packages, that other developers can use to help solve common problems. A package is a collection of Node modules along with a package.json file describing the package.

To work with Node packages we use NPM. NPM includes two things:

1. The NPM registry with a massive collection of Node packages for us to use.
2. The NPM tool that you installed when you installed Node.

**NPM COMMANDS**  
| Command | Description |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| npm start | Execute the current Node package defined by package.json <br> Defaults to executing `node server.js` |
| npm init | Initialize a fresh package.json file |
| npm init -y | Initialize a fresh package.json file, accepting all default options. <br> Equivalent to npm init â€”yes |
| npm install | Equivalent to npm i |
| npm install <package> | Install a package from the NPM registry at www.npmjs.com <br> Equivalent to npm i <package> |
| npm install -D <package> | Install a package as a development dependency <br> Equivalent to npm install â€”save-dev <package> |
| npm install -g <package> | Install a package globally. |
| npm update <package> | Update an already installed package <br> Equivalent to npm up <package> |
| npm uninstall <package> | Uninstall a package from your node_modules/ folder <br> Equivalent to npm un <package> |
| npm outdated | Check for outdated package dependencies |
| npm audit | Check for security vulnerabilities in package dependencies |
| npm audit fix | Try to fix any security vulnerabilities by automatically updating vulnerable packages |

**package.json**  
 Most Node applications we create include a package.json file, which means our Node applications are also Node packages.
_The package.json file contains:_

1. Name, version, description, license of the current package.
2. Scripts to automate tasks like starting, testing, and installing the current package.
3. Lists of dependencies that are required to be installed by the current package.

**node_modules**  
 This folder lives next to your package.json file.  
 When you run `npm install` the packages listed as dependencies in your package.json are downloaded from the NPM registry and put in the node_modules folder.  
 It contains not just your direct dependencies, but also the dependencies of those dependencies. The entire dependency tree lives in node_modules.

**package-lock.json**  
 The package-lock.json file is automatically created by NPM to track the exact versions of packages that are installed in your node_modules folder. Share your package-lock.json with other developers on your team to ensure that everyone is running the exact same versions of every package in the dependency tree.

## Node JS Event Emitter

Node JS provides a built-in module to work with events.

> ```node
> const EventEmitter = require("events");
> const celebrity = new EventEmitter();
>
> celebrity.on("success", () => {
>   console.log("Congratulations! You are the best!");
> });
>
> celebrity.emit("success"); // logs success message
> celebrity.emit("success"); // logs success message again
> celebrity.emit("failure"); // logs nothing
> ```

Many features of Node are modelled with the EventEmitter class. Some examples include the currently running Node `process`, a running HTTP server, and web sockets. They all emit events that can then be listened for using a listener function like `on()`.

For example, we can listen for the exit event on the current running process. In this case, the event has a code associated with it to be more specific about how the process is exiting.

> ```node
> const process = require("process");
>
> process.on("exit", (code) => {
>   console.log(`About to exit with code: ${code}`);
> });
> ```

## Backends with Node JS

**Client-server architecture**  
 Your frontend is usually the client. Your backend is usually the server.  
 In a client-server architecture, clients get access to data (or "resources") from the server. The client can then display and interact with this data.  
 The client and server communicate with each other using the HTTP protocol.

**API**  
 Short for Application Programming Interface.  
 This is the set of functions or operations that your backend server supports. The frontend interacts with the backend by using only these operations.  
 On the web, backend APIs are commonly defined by a list of URLs, corresponding HTTP methods, and any queries and parameters.

**CRUD**  
 Short for Create Read Update and Delete.  
 These are the basic operations that every API supports on collections of data. Your API will usually save (or "persist") these collections of data in a database.

**RESTful**  
 RESTful APIs are those that follow certain constraints. These include:

- Client-server architecture. Clients get access to resources from the server using the HTTP protocol.
- Stateless communication. Each request contains all the information required by the server to handle that request. Every request is separate from every other request.
- Cacheable. The stateless communication makes caching easier.

  In RESTful APIs each of our CRUD operations corresponds to an HTTP method.

  | CRUD Operation | HTTP Method                | Example                                                                                                                        |
  | -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Create         | POST                       | **POST /cards** (save a new card to the cards collection)                                                                      |
  | Read           | GET                        | **GET /cards** (get the whole cards collection) or **GET /cards/:cardId** (get an individual card)                             |
  | Update         | PUT (or more rarely PATCH) | **PUT /cards/:cardId** (update an individual card)                                                                             |
  | Delete         | DELETE                     | **DELETE /cards/:cardId** (delete an individual card) or more rarely **DELETE /cards** (delete the entire collection of cards) |

  ## EXPRESS.JS

  **GET Routes**

  > ```node
  > // Get a whole collection of JSON objects
  > app.get("/cards", (req, res) => {
  >   return res.json(cards);
  > });
  >
  > // Get a specific item in a collection by ID
  > app.get("/cards/:cardId", (req, res) => {
  >   const cardId = req.params.cardId;
  >   return res.json(cards[cardId]);
  > });
  > ```

  **POST Routes**

  > ```node
  > app.post("/cards", (req, res) => {
  >   // Get body from the request
  >   const card = req.body;
  >
  >   // Validate the body
  >   if (!card.value || !card.suit) {
  >     return res.status(400).json({
  >       error: "Missing required card property",
  >     });
  >   }
  >
  >   // Update your collection
  >   cards.push(card);
  >
  >   // Send saved object in the response to verify
  >   return res.json(card);
  > });
  > ```

  **Routers**

  > ```node
  > // In src/cards.router.js
  > const cardsRouter = express.Router();
  >
  > cardsRouter.get("/", (req, res) => {
  >   return res.json(cards);
  > });
  >
  > cardsRouter.get("/:cardId", (req, res) => {
  >   const cardId = req.params.cardId;
  >   return res.json(cards[cardId]);
  > });
  >
  > // In src/api.js
  > const cardsRouter = require("./cards.router");
  >
  > const api = express.Router();
  >
  > api.use("/cards", cardsRouter);
  > ```

  ## Node JS Folder Structure

  One typical folder structure for an API following RESTful architecture and using the Express framework can be found below. Node servers typically follow the Model View Controller pattern. Models live together in one folder. Controllers are grouped together based on which feature or collection they are related to. Views are typically managed by the front end, although some Node servers may serve static HTML or use templating engines like Handlebars.

  > ```text
  > node-project/                   # top level project
  >  node_modules/                  # all installed node packages
  >  data/                          # static data files, if needed
  >    database.json
  >  src/                           # the source code for your server
  >    models/                      # models following the model-view-controller pattern
  >      comment.model.js
  >      post.model.js
  >    routes/                      # one folder for each collection in your API
  >      feeds/                     # folder for the user feeds collection
  >        feed.router.js           # router listing all possible routes for user feeds
  >        feed.controller.js       # controller with the implementation for each route
  >      posts/
  >        post.router.js
  >        post.controller.js
  >      api.js                     # top level router connecting all the above routes
  >    services/                    # any long running services or utilities
  >      mongo.js                   # e.g. connecting to a MongoDB database
  >    app.js                       # all Express middleware and routers
  >    server.js                    # the top level Node HTTP server
  >  .gitignore
  >  package-lock.json
  >  package.json
  > ```

  This is just a reference. In the real world, every project will have differences in the requirements and the ideal project structure.

  ## CROSS ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING

  Something all web developers soon come across is **Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**.

  Browsers follow the **Same Origin Policy (SOP)**, which prevents requests being made across different origins. This is designed to stop malicious servers from stealing information that doesn't belong to them.

  **Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** allows us to allow or whitelist other origins that we trust, so that we can make requests to servers that don't belong to us. For example, with CORS set up properly, https://www.mydomain.com could make a POST request to https://www.yourdomain.com.

  In Express we commonly set up CORS using the following middleware package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors.

  ## PM2 Configuration

  PM2 is a tool we use to create and manage Node.js clusters. It allows us to create clusters of processes, to manage those processes in production, and to keep our applications running forever. We can install the PM2 tool globally using `npm install -g pm2`.

  | Command                  | Description                                                                                                                 |

  | pm2 restart 0            | Restart process with ID 0.                                                                                                  |
  | pm2 delete 0             | Remove process with ID 0 from PM2's list of managed processes.                                                              |
  | pm2 delete all           | Remove all processes from PM2's list.                                                                                       |
  | pm2 reload all           | Zero downtime reload of all processes managed by PM2. For updating and reloading server code already running in production. |
